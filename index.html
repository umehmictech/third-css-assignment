            <p>i will dearly miss Steve Jobs. He inspired me to keep getting the iphones. i have loved them ever since
                the first one. Steve Job was a great man and awesome CEO for Apple. he has inspired me to one day and go
                for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own an apple and follow by stev jobs way
                and make apple greater than before it was but i will dearly miss Steve Jobs. he is a great man and i
                will never forget him</p>
